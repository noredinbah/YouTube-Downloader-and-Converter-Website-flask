# Video Converter and Downloader

This project is a **Video Converter and Downloader** web application built using **Flask** and **yt-dlp**. It allows users to:
1. Download YouTube videos in various qualities.
2. Download YouTube audio and convert it into MP3 format.
3. Convert a local video file into MP3 audio.

## Features
- **Download YouTube Videos**: Users can download videos in different resolutions (e.g., 360p, 720p, 1080p).
- **Download YouTube Audio**: Users can download audio-only versions of YouTube videos.
- **Convert Local Videos to MP3**: Users can upload a local video file, which will be converted to MP3 audio.
- **Dynamic Form**: The form on the web page adapts based on the user's choice (video download, audio download, or file conversion).

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- yt-dlp
- moviepy (for video-to-audio conversion)

You can install the required dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-converter.git
   cd video-converter
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   To run the Flask application locally:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000` in your browser.

## Usage

Once the server is running, go to `http://localhost:5000` and use the form to choose from the following options:

1. **Download YouTube Video**: 
   - Enter the YouTube video link and choose the desired quality (e.g., 360p, 720p, etc.).
   
2. **Download YouTube Audio**: 
   - Enter the YouTube video link, and the audio will be downloaded in MP3 format.
   
3. **Convert Local Video to MP3**: 
   - Upload a local video file (e.g., `.mp4`) and it will be converted into MP3 audio format.

### Example:

- **Video Download**: 
  - You input a YouTube link, select the video quality (e.g., 720p), and the video is downloaded to your device.
  
- **Audio Download**: 
  - You input a YouTube link, and the audio file (MP3) is available for download.

- **Local Video Conversion**: 
  - You upload a `.mp4` file, and it gets converted to `.mp3`.

## Dependencies

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **yt-dlp**: A YouTube downloader, based on `youtube-dl`.
- **moviepy**: A Python library for video editing and manipulation.
- **Pytube** (if you use it instead of yt-dlp for other functionality).

### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install Flask yt-dlp moviepy
```
